WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT HELPU’S SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, ERROR-FREE, OR FREE OF VIRUSES AND OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

HelpU is not intended to be a substitute for professional advice, including medical diagnoses or recommendations. Under no circumstances will we or the University of Pennsylvania be held liable for any harm or loss caused by your reliance on information on the site or on any third-party site recommended or linked to or from the site. It is your responsibility to review the information, advice, and opinions provided on the site, as well as their relevance to you and your condition.

We do not assume any responsibilities or warranties for any content or comments provided by peer counselors on HelpU’s chat platform, nor are we liable to monitor or screen any content, including recommendations and diagnoses, provided by them.
Finally, though we firmly believe in the value of anonymity and are working hard to ensure as much anonymity as possible through this site, we cannot ensure total anonymity for any or all users of this site and therefore assume no responsibilities or disclaimers for the discovery of identity either by users or third-party sites linked to or from the site.
