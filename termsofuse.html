    <h2> HelpU: Terms of Use </h2>
<h4> 1. Disclaimer </h4>
<p class = "text-left"><small> a. We make no representations or warranties whatsoever regarding HelpU and any materials provided by HelpU. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY OR APPEARING TO THE CONTRARY ON THIS SITE OR ELSEWHERE, HELPU AND AFFILIATED MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS-IS,” “AS-AVAILABLE” BASIS. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE AND ALL AFFILIATED PARTIES IN THE CREATION OF HELPU, INCLUDING THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, HEREBY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. WE MAKE NO WARRANTY REGARDING THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, OR MEDICAL VALIDITY OF THE SITE AND ANY RECOMMENDATIONS OR CONCLUSIONS PROVIDED THEREIN. WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT HELPU’S SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, ERROR-FREE, OR FREE OF VIRUSES AND OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. Some jurisdictions do not allow for some of these disclaimers, so portions of the above paragraph may not apply to you.</small>
</p>
<p class = "text-left"> <small>b. HelpU is not intended to be a substitute for professional advice, including medical diagnoses or recommendations. Under no circumstances will we or the University of Pennsylvania be held liable for any harm or loss caused by your reliance on information on the site or on any third-party site recommended or linked to or from the site. It is your responsibility to review the information, advice, and opinions provided on the site, as well as their relevance to you and your condition. We encourage you to seek the advice of professionals, medical or otherwise, regarding any content, and never disregard or avoid professional advice as a result of content found on the site.</p></small>
<p class = "text-left"> <small>c. You are solely responsible for any content you post on the site, including any content written using our chat platform or through any sites linked via HelpU. We assume no responsibility for materials posted by our users, nor do we assume responsibility for screening or monitoring users’ materials.</p></small>
<p class = "text-left"><small> d. We explicitly disclaim any responsibility for the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or medical validity of any third-party site that links to or from our site. We do not make any warranties or representations as to the security of any such site, and do not explicitly endorse any materials or content found therein. We encourage users to investigate and ensure the safety and accuracy of such third-party sites before proceeding with their use.</p></small>
<p class = "text-left"><small> e. We do not assume any responsibilities or warranties for any content or comments provided by peer counselors on HelpU’s chat platform, nor are we liable to monitor or screen any content, including recommendations and diagnoses, provided by them.</p></small>
<p class = "text-left"><small> f. Finally, though we firmly believe in the value of anonymity and are working hard to ensure as much anonymity as possible through this site, we cannot ensure total anonymity for any or all users of this site and therefore assume no responsibilities or disclaimers for the discovery of identity either by users or third-party sites linked to or from the site.</p></small>
